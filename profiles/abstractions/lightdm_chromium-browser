# Profile abstraction for restricting chromium-browser in the lightdm guest session
# Author: Jamie Strandboge <jamie@canonical.com>

# The abstraction provides the additional accesses required to launch
# chromium-browser from within an lightdm session. Because AppArmor cannot yet
# merge profiles and because we want to utilize the access rules provided in
# abstractions/lightdm, this abstraction must be separate from
# abstractions/lightdm.

    # Allow all the same accesses as other applications in the guest session
    #include <abstractions/lightdm>

    # but also allow a few things because of chromium-browser's sandboxing that
    # are not appropriate to other guest session applications.
