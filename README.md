My current /etc/apparmor.d.

Works for me. It breaks stuff. Do not use it in production.

Many profiles come from the apparmor-profiles package. Some are my own.


My goal is not to make sure everything works as it always did: I will deny some 
access I find too permissive and some stuff will not work anymore.
